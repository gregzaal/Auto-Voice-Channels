**Do not create an issue if you are asking for help.** First [read our wiki](https://wiki.dotsbots.com), and then ask your question in our [support server](https://discord.io/DotsBotsSupport).

If you have a **bug report**, please confirm it with at least one other user in the [support server](https://discord.io/DotsBotsSupport) before submitting it here.

If you'd like to **suggest a feature**, first check if the suggestion has already been made in the [issues list](https://github.com/gregzaal/Auto-Voice-Channels/issues), then post it in the #suggestions channel of the [support server](https://discord.io/DotsBotsSupport) to see if anyone else agrees with your idea.
